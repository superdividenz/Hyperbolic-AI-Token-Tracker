Implementation Steps
Step 1: Set Up the Project
Initialize a React.js project with create-react-app or Vite.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install @solana/web3.js @supabase/supabase-js tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer d3.js
Set up Tailwind CSS:

bash
Copy
npx tailwindcss init -p
Step 2: Integrate Phantom Wallet
Create a Wallet.js component to connect to Phantom Wallet and fetch assets (as shown earlier).

Fetch SOL balance, SPL tokens, and NFTs using the Solana Web3.js library.

Step 3: Build the Hyperbolic Visualization
Use D3.js or Three.js to render the portfolio in hyperbolic space.

Represent assets as nodes and relationships as edges.

Allow users to interact with the visualization (e.g., zoom, pan, click for details).

Step 4: Add AI-Powered Insights
Use hyperbolic embeddings to cluster assets based on attributes like risk, category, or market behavior.

Provide recommendations for portfolio diversification or risk management.

Step 5: Set Up the Backend with Supabase
Create a Supabase project and set up a database to store user preferences, portfolio snapshots, or AI-generated insights.

Use Supabase Auth for user authentication (optional).

Step 6: Create the UI
Use Tailwind CSS to design a clean, modern interface.

Add interactive components like:

Wallet connection button.

Portfolio summary cards.

Hyperbolic visualization canvas.

AI insights panel.

Step 7: Test and Deploy
Test the application locally.

Deploy the frontend using Vercel or Netlify.

Deploy the backend (Supabase) and ensure everything is connected.

Example Workflow
User Connects Wallet: The user connects their Phantom Wallet to the app.

Fetch Data: The app fetches the user’s SOL balance, SPL tokens, and NFTs.

Hyperbolic Visualization: The app visualizes the portfolio in hyperbolic space.

AI Insights: The app provides AI-driven insights (e.g., “Your portfolio is heavily weighted in high-risk assets”).

User Interaction: The user interacts with the visualization and explores insights.

Optional Enhancements
NFT Integration: Allow users to visualize their NFT collections in hyperbolic space.

DeFi Integration: Fetch data from DeFi protocols (e.g., Marinade, Raydium) and include it in the portfolio.

Gamification: Add gamified elements like achievements for portfolio diversification.

Why This Project?
Unique: Combines hyperbolic geometry with crypto portfolio management.

Functional: Provides real value to users by helping them visualize and optimize their portfolios.

Modern Tech Stack: Uses cutting-edge tools like Solana, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS.
